# Hi there, I'm Moaz Sabra! 👋

### Aspiring Django Backend Developer | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Pentester in Training

I'm passionate about building robust, scalable web applications and constantly learning about new technologies and security practices. My journey in tech started with automating daily tasks with Python, and now I'm focused on mastering Django for backend development. I'm also deeply fascinated by cybersecurity and plan to specialize in penetration testing in the future. I believe a strong understanding of how applications are built is key to effectively securing them.
